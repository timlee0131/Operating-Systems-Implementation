# Operating Systems Algorithm Implementation
### Part of CS7343 Operating Systems course at Southern Methodist University

Most of the projects in this directory use multithreading and cache replacement algorithms to solve various problems. For example, in one project, I simulate an N-player game with threads $1..n$ representing players $1..n$ that engage in a game simultaneously. The objective of simulating such games and scenarios is to implement multithreading or caching algorithms in a safe manner that avoids deadlock and correctly identifies appropriate threads as winners and losers in simultaneous, parallel computing design
